## Clone and run locally

1. First clone this repo

2. Use `cd` to change into the app's directory

   ```bash
   cd legacy
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

4. You can now run the Electron app:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

> Note it's very much in dev mode until further notice.


Happy coding!
